Second-Order Kuramoto Model Simulator in Python for Power Networks Application
The simulator within use the odeint Python function to solve the Kuramoto model at nodes in a network
The user is required to manually input values by changing the code itself, the simulator does not accept data from external files
The code is heavily commented to direct the user through what's required.
